# Women's Health MCP - Enhanced Multi-Modal Context Protocol

🚀 **Multi-Modal Context Protocol for Women's Health AI Agents**

A comprehensive Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementation that addresses the critical infrastructure gap in women's health AI systems. This enhanced MCP provides AI agents with standardized, real-time access to reproductive health data sources while maintaining HIPAA compliance and privacy protection.

## 🌟 Challenge Solution Overview

This implementation solves the core problem identified in: **the lack of standardized infrastructure for women's health AI systems**. Our enhanced MCP enables AI agents to access:

- ✅ **Clinical Data**: EHRs (FHIR), lab results, imaging
- ✅ **Research Databases**: SWAN, SART, PubMed, clinical trials
- ✅ **Clinical Calculators**: Ovarian reserve, IVF success, menopause prediction
- ✅ **Guidelines**: ASRM, ESHRE treatment protocols
- ✅ **Patient-Generated Data**: Cycle tracking apps, wearables

## 📊 Enhanced Capabilities

### Multi-Modal Data Access
The enhanced MCP processes questions like *"I'm 38, AMH is 0.8, FSH is 12, trying to conceive—should I do IVF now or wait?"* with:

- 🔒 **Privacy Protection**: HIPAA-compliant consent management and encryption
- 📱 **Real-time Data**: Live sync from cycle tracking apps and wearables
- 🧮 **Clinical Calculators**: Ovarian reserve assessment, IVF success prediction, menopause timing
- 📊 **Population Data**: SWAN menopause studies, SART IVF success rates
- 🔬 **Latest Research**: Real-time PubMed queries for recent systematic reviews
- 🏥 **EHR Integration**: FHIR-compliant data exchange with healthcare systems
- 🎯 **AI Synthesis**: Evidence-based recommendations with confidence intervals

### Sample Enhanced Output
```
URGENT RECOMMENDATION: Begin IVF consultation immediately.
Your age (38) and AMH level (0.8 ng/mL) indicate time-sensitive fertility concerns.
SART data shows 19% success rate for your profile, but success rates decline rapidly with age.

EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS:
• Ovarian reserve: very_low (15th percentile for age) - ASRM 2024 guidelines
• IVF success: 19% live birth rate (SART 2023, n=54,321 cycles)
• Menopause timing: Predicted at 49.2 years (SWAN study validation)
• Cycle health: 0.73 regularity score from 90 days of tracking
• Research evidence: 3 recent systematic reviews support AMH-guided treatment timing
