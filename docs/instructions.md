I'm solving challenge for hackathon. The sponsors are Netmind AI, Biomni AI and Manus AI. Would be nice to use them, but don't have to.
## **: Multi-Modal Context Protocol for Women's Health AI Agents**

**Theme:** Women Longevity Infrastructure + Reproductive Longevity

### Why Does It Matter Now?

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is a new standard for connecting AI systems to external data sources enabling LLMs to access real-time medical records, research databases, and clinical guidelines. However, **no MCP exists specifically for women's health**, creating a critical infrastructure gap.

When a patient asks an AI: *"I'm 38, AMH is 0.8, FSH is 12, trying to conceive—should I do IVF now or wait?"* current AI systems:

- Can't access patient's full hormonal history from EHR
- Don't retrieve latest IVF success rates by age/AMH from SART database
- Can't cross-reference SWAN data for menopause timing predictions
- Miss relevant recent papers on AMH interpretation

An **MCP for women health** would provide AI agents with structured, real-time access to:

1. **Clinical data:** EHRs (FHIR), lab results, imaging
2. **Research databases:** SWAN, ELSA, PubMed, clinical trials
3. **Clinical calculators:** Ovarian reserve, IVF success, menopause prediction
4. **Guidelines:** ASRM, ESHRE, NAMS treatment protocols
5. **Patient-generated data:** Cycle tracking apps, wearables

With women's health AI becoming a $50B market (diagnostic assistants, virtual menopause clinics, fertility coaches), MCP standardization could enable an ecosystem of interoperable AI agents grounded in medical evidence.

### Current Solutions & Shortcomings

**Existing infrastructure:**

- **FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources)** - EHR data exchange standard, but doesn't cover research databases or AI-specific queries

**Critical gaps:**

- No standardized way for AI to query SWAN, NHANES, or other women's health datasets
- Clinical calculators (AMH interpretation, IVF success) exist as siloed web tools, not AI-accessible APIs
- Patient data fragmented across cycle apps (Clue), wearables (Oura), EHRs—no unified interface
- Privacy/security considerations for reproductive health data not addressed in generic MCPs


### Suggested Flow

1. **Define your problem & success metric**
    - Use **Manus AI** as your co-pilot — for problem identification, reviewing current solutions, reasoning next steps, and market research.
2. **Find the data**
    - Use **Manus AI** for dataset exploration.
    - Use **Hugging Face Hub** for model discovery — find pretrained biomedical or multimodal models to fine-tune or repurpose.
3. **Prototype**
    - Focus on building a **working demo** — something you can *show*, not just describe.
    - Use **Netmind AI Cloud** for compute — deploy your notebooks or models here for GPU power, collaboration, and shared workspaces.
    - Use **Biomni** for automating data processing or analysis pipelines — it can run APIs, scripts, or pipeline steps automatically.
4. **Final testing and rehearsals**
    - Run everything once from scratch — make sure your code executes cleanly.
    - Rehearse your **7-min pitch** and prepare for the **5-min Q&A**.
    - Show something live or include a short demo video.
