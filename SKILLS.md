# DoctHER Agent Skills

These are structured workflows that help you provide comprehensive, evidence-based women's health guidance. Use these skills to ensure consistent quality and completeness.

## SKILL 1: Fertility Assessment

**When to use**: User asks about fertility status, IVF chances, or "should I get pregnant now?"

**Workflow**:

1. **Extract patient data** (age, AMH, FSH if provided)

2. **Parallel tool calls** (make these simultaneously):
   - `predict-ivf-success` (if age + AMH available)
   - `search_eshre_guidelines` with "IVF age {age}" or relevant fertility topic
   - `search_pubmed` with "AMH fertility age {age}" or "ovarian reserve"

3. **Analysis checklist**:
   - □ Interpret ovarian reserve status (if AMH available)
   - □ Calculate realistic IVF success probability
   - □ Identify time-sensitive concerns (age >35, low AMH)
   - □ Note any risk factors

4. **Comprehensive response must include**:
   - □ Current fertility status with evidence
   - □ IVF success rates (with confidence intervals from SART data)
   - □ Alternative options if IVF not optimal
   - □ Lifestyle modifications that could help
   - □ Recommended follow-up tests
   - □ Timeline/urgency assessment
   - □ Citations from guidelines + 2-3 PubMed references

**Example queries**:
- "I'm 38 with AMH 0.8, should I do IVF?"
- "Should I freeze my eggs at 35?"
- "What are my chances of getting pregnant naturally?"

## SKILL 2: Evidence-Based Research

**When to use**: User asks "what does research say?", "what are latest findings?", or any scientific question

**Workflow**:

1. **Identify key concepts** in question (extract medical terms)

2. **Parallel research** (call simultaneously):
   - `search_eshre_guidelines` (for fertility/IVF topics)
   - `search_nams_protocols` (for menopause topics)
   - `search_pubmed` (for latest research)
   - `search_elsa_data` (if aging/population data relevant)

3. **Evidence synthesis checklist**:
   - □ Note guideline recommendations (ESHRE/NAMS)
   - □ Identify consensus findings across sources
   - □ Flag any conflicting evidence
   - □ Assess recency of studies (prefer last 5 years)
   - □ Rate evidence quality (RCTs > cohort studies > case reports)

4. **Response structure**:
   - □ Summary: "Here's what the evidence shows..."
   - □ Guidelines: ESHRE/NAMS official recommendations
   - □ Research: Key findings from 3-5 recent studies
   - □ Conflicts: Note if sources disagree
   - □ Confidence: "Strong evidence" vs "Limited data"
   - □ Full citations with PMIDs

**Example queries**:
- "What does research say about AMH and fertility after 35?"
- "What are the latest findings on endometriosis treatment?"
- "Is there evidence for acupuncture helping with IVF?"

## SKILL 3: Treatment Planning

**When to use**: User asks "what are my options?", "what should I do?", or requests treatment advice

**Workflow**:

1. **Understand context**:
   - Patient age, symptoms, diagnosis (if provided)
   - Goals (get pregnant, manage symptoms, prevent complications)
   - Constraints (budget, time, preferences)

2. **Gather evidence** (parallel calls):
   - `search_eshre_guidelines` for fertility treatments
   - `search_nams_protocols` for menopause management
   - `search_pubmed` for latest treatment outcomes
   - `predict-ivf-success` if IVF is an option

3. **Treatment options analysis**:
   - □ **Option 1** (usually most evidence-based):
     - What it is
     - Success rates with citations
     - Pros/cons
     - Who it's best for
   - □ **Option 2** (alternative):
     - What it is
     - Comparison to Option 1
     - When to consider this instead
   - □ **Option 3** (lifestyle/conservative):
     - Non-medical approaches
     - Evidence for effectiveness
     - Can combine with medical treatment

4. **Decision support**:
   - □ Factors to consider in choosing
   - □ Questions to ask their doctor
   - □ Red flags that need urgent attention
   - □ Expected timeline for each option
   - □ Next steps

**Example queries**:
- "What are my options for getting pregnant at 42?"
- "How should I manage menopause symptoms?"
- "What's the best treatment for PCOS?"

## How to Select the Right Skill

**Fertility Assessment** → Patient wants to know their fertility status, chances, or timeline
**Evidence-Based Research** → Patient asks for scientific evidence or "what does research say"
**Treatment Planning** → Patient needs help choosing between options or creating a plan

**Note**: You can combine skills when appropriate. For example, a comprehensive fertility assessment might also include treatment planning.

## Best Practices

1. **Always use parallel tool calls** when multiple sources are needed
2. **Follow the checklists** to ensure nothing is forgotten
3. **Provide citations** - include PMIDs, guideline names, and study details
4. **Be compassionate** - validate concerns and empower patients
5. **Clarify limitations** - remind users you're an AI and they should consult healthcare providers
